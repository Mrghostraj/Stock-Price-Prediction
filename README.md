Just completed my Stock Price Prediction project for Reliance Industries using Deep Learning and News Sentiment Analysis — and achieved an R² score of 0.9742!(which means my model was 97.42% close to the actual price)

What I used:
Random Forest Regression: R² score of 0.7674!
Neural Network (Keras + TensorFlow)
Technical indicators: Moving Average(MA5 & MA10)
News sentiment scoring (VADER)
Historical stock data from Yahoo Finance
Sentiment-integrated feature engineering

The model accurately captures both market trends and real-world news impact, bringing together finance and AI.

Also added an input section where someone can input the date for the close price prediction.
Excited to extend this into real-time predictions and portfolio-level modeling!
